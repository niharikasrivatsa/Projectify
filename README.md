# Projectify

## Overview
Projectify is a *super cool slay girlboss* app that was sparked at a hackathon we randomly decided to participate in (*we <3 WIE*). 
"**What is Projectify?**" you ask? Well, Projectify is a mobile app (*work in progress #manifesting*) that connects high school girls 
looking to work on side projects with others. Through the app they can find side project inspiration, share their **GRAND** project
ideas, meet people to work with on the projects, and earn accomplishments badges to build their professional portfolio.

We had like **4 hours** (*yikes!*) to come up with this all, so it was pretty messy you might imagine. BUT! We won second place in
the hackathon (woot woot #women #in #stem)!! And, that motivated us to really trying to develop this (*syde*) project(*ify ;*). This 
is a first for a lot of us, so enjoy this archive of our *blood, sweat, and tears* + all the lessons we learn along the way! 😍

Note: always remember to `git pull` for the most updated version of the code before making changes!
