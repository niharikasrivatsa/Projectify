# Projectify

## Overview
Projectify is a *super cool slay girlboss* app that was born at a hackathon we randomly decided to participate in (*we <3 WIE*). 
"**What is Projectify?**" you ask? Well, Projectify is a mobile app (*work in progress #manifesting*) that connects high school girls 
looking to work on side projects with others. Through the app they can find side project inspiration, share their **GRAND** project
ideas, meet people to work with on the projects, and earn accomplishments badges to build their professional portfolio.

We had like **4 hours** (*yikes!*) to come up with this all, so it was pretty messy you might imagine. BUT! We won second place in
the hackathon (woot woot #women #in #stem)!! And, that motivated us to really try to develop this (*syde*) project(*ify ;*). This 
is a first for a lot of us, so enjoy this archive of our *blood, sweat, and tears* + all the lessons we learn along the way!

We are still working on the design and development of the project. Find the two iterations of our app [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/fMyEdVA4qwRyJN0MUNTzcA/Projectify?page-id=641%3A15507&node-id=643%3A21143&viewport=241%2C-46%2C0.07&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=643%3A20382&show-proto-sidebar=1)!

First and foremost, clone the project!

1) **Install Nodejs**
    - [Download | Node.js (nodejs.org)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 
    - Check node version (must be 12 or higher) 
        -  run `node -v`

2) **Download Expo Go/Expo Client on your phone**
    - This is to help us see it on an actual device 
    - Android or iOS simulator also works
   
4) **Add This File**
    - Create a new file under the "src" folder named `aws-exports.js`
    - Copy & Paste [this](https://janviganatra.notion.site/aws-exports-js-e490c312ea0f495baf74633f877aadca) into file

5) **Run `npm install` and `npm start`**
    - Scan the QR code in the terminal with your phone
    - Type `r` in the terminal to reload the app on your phone
