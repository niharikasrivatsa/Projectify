# Projectify

## Overview
Projectify is a *super cool slay girlboss* app that was sparked at a hackathon we randomly decided to participate in (*we <3 WIE*). 
"**What is Projectify?**" you ask? Well, Projectify is a mobile app (*work in progress #manifesting*) that connects high school girls 
looking to work on side projects with others. Through the app they can find side project inspiration, share their **GRAND** project
ideas, meet people to work with on the projects, and earn accomplishments badges to build their professional portfolio.

We had like **4 hours** (*yikes!*) to come up with this all, so it was pretty messy you might imagine. BUT! We won second place in
the hackathon (woot woot #women #in #stem)!! And, that motivated us to really trying to develop this (*syde*) project(*ify ;*). This 
is a first for a lot of us, so enjoy this archive of our *blood, sweat, and tears* + all the lessons we learn along the way! 😍

First and foremost, clone the project!

1) **Install Nodejs**

    - check node version (must be 12 or higher) 
        -  run `node -v`

2) **Download Expo Go/Expo Client on your phone**
    - this is to help us test on an actual device 

3) **Add Extentions on VS code**
    - react native tools by Microsoft
    - react native/react/redux by EQuimper
    - prettier - code formatter
    - material icon theme by Philipp Kief

4) **Run `npm start`**
    - sometimes you need to run `npm install` before running this
    - scan the QR code in the terminal with your phone
    - type `r` in the terminal to reload the app on your phone

## Git Stuff

3) Add all files you want to push: 
    - `git add .` to add all changed files
    - `git add [filepath]` to add a specific file
4) Commit the files + add a cute/informative message 😻
